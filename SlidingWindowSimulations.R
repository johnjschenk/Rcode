#### R code to plot a sliding window and simulated plots.  Simulations are based on the birth-death model. 
#Code generated for Schenk and Steppan "The role of biogeography in adaptive radiation"
#Code generate by J. Schenk 2017
#Code dependent on the Geiger package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/index.html; HARMON, L. J., J. T. WEIR, C. D. BROCK, R. E. GLOR, AND  W. CHALLENGER. 2008. GEIGER:  Investigating evolutionary radiations. Bioinformatics 24: 129–131.)
#User must include a chronogram, window size (2 million years was used in our publication), the number of simulations (default set to 100), speciation rate, extinction rate, the number of tips (n), and the age of the clade (t).  The last four settings are conditions under which the birth-death trees will be simulated.
