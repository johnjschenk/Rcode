SlidingWindow.R and SlidingWindowSimulations.R were written for Steppand and Schenk "Muroid Rodent Phylogenetics: 900-species Tree Reveals Increasing Diversification Rates" and Schenk and Steppan "The role of biogeography in adaptive radiation".  This code is based on MEREDITH, R. W., J. E. JANEčKA, J. GATESY, O. A. RYDER, C. A. FISHER, E. C. TEELING, A. GOODBLA, et al. 2011. Impacts of the Cretaceous terrestrial revolution and KPg extinction on mammal diversification. Science 334: 521–524.  

The NodeAgeDensity code will estimate a 95% HPD for a particular node age and generate a density plot.
